This is to give options to pick the hospital for government affiliation.\n6. If there is no hospital in the zone, check if there is at least one hospital in the clusters( to which this zone belongs to).\n7. List at least one hospital, from the list of hospitals in the zone, to tag to the zones which does not have hospitals otherwise.\n8. If there is not hospital even in the cluster, then that would indicate that there is a need for the hospital in that area. Suggest government to build at least one hospital in that zone/cluster.\n9.
